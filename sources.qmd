**Global Socio-Economic & Environmental Indicators**

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toriqulstu/global-socio-economic-and-environmental-indicators/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toriqulstu/global-socio-economic-and-environmental-indicators/data)

The following datasets was pulled from Kaggle:
co2_production.csv, 
gross_national_income_per_capital.csv, 
human_development_index.csv, 
life_expectancy_by_birth.csv 

Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between life expectancy and socio-economic factors.

I merged the datasets on the common identifier (assuming "Country" is the common columns).

I handled missing values (e.g., by removing rows with NA values).
